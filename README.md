## Description

This project is designed to be a single work day, hourly scheduler. Users are able to update and save events in local storage. Events are color coded to show if the events on the scheduler are in the past, present or future hours. Moment.js is used to update the current date, keep track of the current time, and update the scheduler every five minutes without having to refresh the page.
